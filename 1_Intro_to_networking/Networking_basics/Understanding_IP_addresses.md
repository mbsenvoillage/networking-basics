# Understanding IP Addresses

## Lesson 1: Introduction to IP Addresses

### Definition and Purpose of IP Addresses

#### What is an IP Address?

- An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a **unique string of numbers** separated by periods (IPv4) or colons (IPv6) that **identifies each computer** using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network.
- It functions like a home address, providing a specific location for data to be delivered.

#### Role in Network Communication

- IP addresses are essential for any device (like computers, smartphones, or servers) to communicate on the Internet or local networks.
- **They allow the network to differentiate between different devices and route data correctly**.

### IPv4 vs. IPv6

#### Differences and Why IPv6 Came into Existence

- IPv4 uses 32 bits for its addresses, leading to over 4 billion unique addresses. However, with the explosive growth of the internet, these addresses are depleting.
- IPv6, the successor to IPv4, uses 128 bits, which significantly increases the number of possible addresses, virtually eliminating the risk of depletion.

#### Understanding IPv6 Address Format

- IPv6 addresses are written as **eight groups of four hexadecimal digits**, each group representing 16 bits. Groups are separated by colons.
- An example IPv6 address: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.

#### How IP Addresses Work

- Assigning IP Addresses :

Devices can receive IP addresses statically (manually assigned and unchanging) or dynamically (assigned by a server, typically using DHCP, and can change over time).

- Routing :

IP addresses play a crucial role in routing data packets across networks. Routers use the IP address to decide the best path to forward each packet of data.

- Local vs Global :

Local (or private) IP addresses are used within a home or business network and are not directly exposed to the internet.

Public IP addresses are used on the internet. Each device or network that directly connects to the internet must have a unique public IP address.

#### The Significance of IP Addresses

- Identifying Devices :

Each device on a network has a unique IP address, ensuring accurate delivery and receipt of data.

- Connectivity and Accessibility :

Without an IP address, devices would not be able to access the internet or communicate with other networked devices.

- Security Implications :

IP addresses can be used to track a device's location and internet activity, raising privacy and security concerns. This is why VPNs and proxies are often used to mask real IP addresses.
