# Understanding IP Addresses

## Lesson 1: Introduction to IP Addresses

### Definition and Purpose of IP Addresses

#### What is an IP Address?

- An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a **unique string of numbers** separated by periods (IPv4) or colons (IPv6) that **identifies each computer** using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network.
- It functions like a home address, providing a specific location for data to be delivered.

#### Role in Network Communication

- IP addresses are essential for any device (like computers, smartphones, or servers) to communicate on the Internet or local networks.
- **They allow the network to differentiate between different devices and route data correctly**.

### IPv4 vs. IPv6

#### Differences and Why IPv6 Came into Existence

- IPv4 uses 32 bits for its addresses, leading to over 4 billion unique addresses. However, with the explosive growth of the internet, these addresses are depleting.
- IPv6, the successor to IPv4, uses 128 bits, which significantly increases the number of possible addresses, virtually eliminating the risk of depletion.

#### Understanding IPv6 Address Format

- IPv6 addresses are written as **eight groups of four hexadecimal digits**, each group representing 16 bits. Groups are separated by colons.
- An example IPv6 address: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.

#### How IP Addresses Work

- Assigning IP Addresses :

Devices can receive IP addresses statically (manually assigned and unchanging) or dynamically (assigned by a server, typically using DHCP, and can change over time).

- Routing :

IP addresses play a crucial role in routing data packets across networks. Routers use the IP address to decide the best path to forward each packet of data.

- Local vs Global :

Local (or private) IP addresses are used within a home or business network and are not directly exposed to the internet.

Public IP addresses are used on the internet. Each device or network that directly connects to the internet must have a unique public IP address.

#### The Significance of IP Addresses

- Identifying Devices :

Each device on a network has a unique IP address, ensuring accurate delivery and receipt of data.

- Connectivity and Accessibility :

Without an IP address, devices would not be able to access the internet or communicate with other networked devices.

- Security Implications :

IP addresses can be used to track a device's location and internet activity, raising privacy and security concerns. This is why VPNs and proxies are often used to mask real IP addresses.

## Lesson 2: Structure of an IP Address

### IPv4 Address Structure

#### Understanding Binary and Decimal Formats

- An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number, usually represented in decimal format for human readability, divided into four 8-bit fields called octets.
- Each octet is a decimal representation of a binary number ranging from 0 to 255.
- Example: The IP address 192.168.1.1 in binary would be 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001.

#### IPv4 Address Representation

- The dotted decimal format is the standard representation for IPv4 addresses.
- Each part of the address ranges from 0 to 255, representing a byte of the IP address.
- Example: In the address 192.168.1.1, 192 is the first byte, 168 is the second byte, and so on.

### IPv6 Address Structure

#### Hexadecimal Format and Its Necessity

- IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long, divided into eight 16-bit blocks.
- Each block is represented as four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons.
- Example: An IPv6 address might look like 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.

#### Compression and Expansion

- Leading zeros within a block can be omitted for brevity.
- Consecutive blocks of zeros can be replaced with a double colon (::), but this can only be done once in an IPv6 address to avoid ambiguity.
- Example: The address 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:1428:57ab can be compressed to 2001:0db8::1428:57ab.

### Subnetting Basics

#### What is Subnetting?

- Subnetting is a method to divide a network into smaller, more efficient subnetworks (or subnets).
- It is done by extending the natural boundary of an IP address to allow for more efficient use of IP addresses.

#### Purpose and Benefits

- Increases routing efficiency.
- Enhances network security and performance.
- Helps in better organization and management of network resources.

### Understanding Subnet Masks

#### Definition and Role of a Subnet Mask

- A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that masks an IP address and divides the IP address into network address and host address.
- Subnet masks are used to designate the network and host portions of an IP address.
- The subnet mask determines which part of the IP address refers to the network and which part refers to the node (or host).
- For example, in the IP address 192.168.1.10 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, the 192.168.1 part represents the network, and 10 represents the host within that network.

#### CIDR Notation

- Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation is a method of denoting the network and usable host ranges in an IP address.
- CIDR uses a suffix like /24 to denote how many bits are used for the network part of the address.
- The format is an IP address, followed by a slash, and then a number (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
- The number after the slash represents the number of consecutive 1's in the subnet mask. For example, /24 means the first 24 bits are used for the network part of the address.

#### Example of a Subnet Mask in Use

- Consider an IP address 192.168.1.5 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.
- This mask in binary is 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000.
- Applying this mask to the IP address, the network portion is 192.168.1 and the host portion is .5.

#### CIDR Notation Example

- An address 192.168.1.0/24 indicates a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.
- This means the network part of the address includes the first 24 bits (192.168.1), and the remaining 8 bits are for host addresses.

### Practical Application: Subnetting a Network

#### Objective

Divide a network into smaller subnetworks to improve management, security, and utilization of IP addresses.

#### Scenario and Task

You have a network with the address 192.168.1.0/24 and need to create four subnets.
Each subnet should have an equal number of hosts.

### Steps for Subnetting

Calculate the new subnet mask: Since you need four subnets, divide the 256 addresses into four groups. This requires two additional bits (as 2^2 = 4). So, the new subnet mask is /26 (or 255.255.255.192).
Determine the subnets:
Subnet 1: 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.63
Subnet 2: 192.168.1.64 to 192.168.1.127
Subnet 3: 192.168.1.128 to 192.168.1.191
Subnet 4: 192.168.1.192 to 192.168.1.255
Assigning IP Addresses

Assign IP addresses within each subnet. For example, in Subnet 1, valid host addresses range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.62.
